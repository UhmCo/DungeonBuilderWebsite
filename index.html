You have 100 lives to escape before your soul joins the dungeon forever. It's Tetris meets Hades with a ticking corruption clock.</p>

What started as summer coding projects has evolved into a shared mission: creating games that make players stop, think, and experience something unexpected. They believe the best games are the ones that surprise youâ€”the ones that make you say "uhm... this is awesome!"</p>
