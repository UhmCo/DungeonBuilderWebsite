                Project Dungeon Builder is in early development and we're building a small, 
                driven team to shape it together. Right now, we're especially looking for a 
                <strong>Concept Artist</strong> to help define the look and feel of our world but if you 
                can do more than one thing, even better. We value collaborators who wear multiple hats.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is a <strong>revenue share indie project</strong>: we're not promising salaries, but 
                we are promising ownership, creative freedom, and a real shot at shipping something. 
                Our goal is to <strong>self-publish</strong> through Kickstarter, Patreon, or other means while 
                keeping the studio independent and retaining IP ownership.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you're excited about experimental mechanics, sketching fantasy worlds, and helping a 
                small team push something into reality, we'd love to hear from you.
            </p>
